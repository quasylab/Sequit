# Introduction

***Sequit*** is a lightweight and ready-to-use player developed in Unity that can be easily operated by everyone to represent agent traces. 

The tool has been conceived to be used in pair with [Sibilla](https://github.com/quasylab/sibilla), a Java framework designed to support analysis of Collective Adaptive Systems, but can also be used as a standalone solution.

In fact, the traces can be formatted using a `csv ` file type and easily uploaded to the platform.

# Features

Currently, ***Sequit*** support the following features:

- **Switching  Cameras**: The tool includes an *eagle-eye camera* and a *rotatory camera*. The first on is set above the plane, while the other one is set around a focal point.
- **Simulation Control**: The tool allows the user to stop/resume the visualisation. Moreover it is possible to speed up/slow down the replay.
- **Generating Agents**: The tool permits to load agents traces in order to generate them. These can be generated in a 2D or 3D environment.
